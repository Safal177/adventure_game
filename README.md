This project is a simple text-associated adventure game generated in Python using VS Code and GitHub Copilot.

# Topic with short explanation
Adventure Game: 
An interactive text-related adventure game was made in Python using VS Code and GitHub Copilot. My project shows my basic programming skills such as functions, loops, conditionals, 
and user input processing. This project is also part of my portfolio showing my decision-making skills with Python coding. 

# Project overview:
My project is a basic Python focusing adventure game where players select options that reflect different results. The project includes:
Basic Python programming skills
“if/elif/else” conditions used for control flow
Create functions to organize code
Use text prompts for interactive gameplay

# Key elements:

Text related to user interaction  
More than one decision path
Playable more than one time with different results 
Friendly generated Python code structure
